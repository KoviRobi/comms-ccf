# Circular buffer

As data arrives in the interrupt of the driver, it needs to be queued
for an application thread to process it. This class is a simple circular
buffer that can support either bytes for a pre-allocated buffer, or
pointers for a dynamically sized buffer.

Though because it includes the size of the data, it is optimised for
storing data not pointers -- as it would just waste half of the space for
pointers as size of a pointer is known. This is done because even though
we know the total readable size of the buffer, the buffer might contain
multiple packets, and we want to know where each packet starts and ends.

The basis of the circular buffer is based on the Lamport Queue, the basic
Lamport Queue uses two cursors, one for read and one for write, and a
buffer which is a size of power of two (see XXX). It is a concurrent,
single producer single consumer queue, which means there are some subtle
considerations:

1. the queue may be pushed to and popped from concurrently (though not
   pushed by multiple different threads concurrently, or popped from
   concurrently);
2. because the queue size is a power of two, the difference between the
   write and read cursors is always valid even if one or both of them
   have wrapped. Strictly speaking the requirement is that the queue
   size and the cursors wrap to zero at the same time, but it is easiest
   to acheive by having the cursors wrap naturally at a power of two,
   and having the queue size a power of two is probably not a huge
   restriction.

The modification we have done to the standard Lamport Queue is having
another cursor which is always bounded by the read and write cursors,
and is used to keep track of where the next packet is which we haven't
notified the consumer of. This allows us to store the length of the
packet at the start of the packet, and also to drop packets which cannot
fit into the buffer.

This does mean that we need to know how big a packet can be (specifically,
how many bytes to allocate for the packet size pointer), but this is
fine for now.

TODO: Currently this was written for architectures which don't reorder
reads/writes, in my case small microcontrollers without caches and write
buffers, but needs to be fixed by using atomics on the cursors and the
buffer to ensure the cursors point to valid data (by the time the updated
cursor is read, the value at that location has been written).

TODO: This does not expose an interface for DMA engines, but this could
fairly easily be added by getting the current next contiguous unused
part of the buffer (i.e. the part before any wrapping) and passing that
to the DMA engine.

TODO: Forward and bidirectional iterator/range for Iterator/Frame.
